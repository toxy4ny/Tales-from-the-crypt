# A Graceful Attack: SQL Injection through XSS Flaw in Contact Form 7
---
# Introduction

In the realm of cybersecurity, there are always those who can turn a vulnerability into a doorway leading to unprotected reservoirs of data. In the Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress, not only has a reflected XSS vulnerability been discovered (CVE-2024-2242), but there's also a unique opportunity to execute SQL Injection, much like a series of deceitful masks swapping places in a single masquerade. Let’s unveil the cards:

# Nuances of Exploitation: SQL Injection via XSS

At first glance, the XSS vulnerability in this plugin seems blatantly typical: a user input element, lacking proper filtration, suddenly appears on screen, enhancing HTML, enabling attacks on an administrator via the link: https:///wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpcf7&post=$FORMID&active-tab=1%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dalert%281%29%2F%2F%3E. However, in the intricate play of shadow and light, the XSS vulnerability opens the door to deeper manipulations for a hacker. Since special characters don't undergo proper sanitization, it allows for discreet exfiltration of the entire database from the site.
Theatrical Staging of the Attack and Participants:

    Setting the Scene:
        It all begins with a simple parameter in a GET request. The potential of XSS here is merely the tip of the iceberg.

    The Hidden Passage:
        The parameter active-tab1, along with the AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING - subquery comment (white string =), possesses the capability to become an SQL Injection. An attacker can inject it gracefully, like an invisible needle piercing the fabric of security systems and WAF.

    Climax:
        Through the enumeration of other, more complex SQL Injection queries, the attacker reaches the very essence of SQL Injection (it is recommended to use sqlmap for this purpose).

# Protecting the Stage: Preventing a Double Game

To avoid becoming a hostage to the XSS vulnerability once again, it is necessary to close this vulnerability:
Measures of Escaping and Data Validation:

    Always use escaping; if not possible, block the vulnerable parameter on the WAF from external access.
    Use in code:

    php

Copy code

sanitize_text_field($_GET['active-tab1']));

Multiplying Defense Mechanisms:

    Integrate Wordfence and other similar tools.

# Final Aria

This story is a reminder of the constant vigilance and study of the art of cybersecurity, which sometimes resembles the choreography of a waltz between vulnerabilities and protective mechanisms. Strive for mastery in this game of light and shadow, where each vulnerability can become decisive in the entire play.
